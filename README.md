# Telescope Finder Rings
---------------------
These rings clip onto an inexpensive telescope which had no pointing aid.  
The finder rings have a tab with a small hole through which the user looks while pointing.
Two finder rings are fabricated. They are placed as far apart from each other as possible. One near the objective lens and one near the focuser.
These rings allow the user to point the telescope at distant objects with zero magnification.
Zero magnification is important for the initial pointing.
By looking around and past the small tabs you get a rough pointing and looking through the small holes you get a finer pointing.

At first use the telescope must be pointed at some distant easy to find object and the finder rings calibrated (rotated) to that target object.
The rings are then temporaraly secured in place with tape.

### 1. Set a Distant Target  
Place an image at a significant distance or choose a specific target as your focal point.

The target is the white and red ball.

### 2. Locate the Target Using the Eyepiece  
Navigate and find the target through the eyepiece. Once the object is visible, stop moving the telescope.

### 3. Align the Finder Rings  
Adjust the finder rings so that when looking through both holes, the target object is centered. **Do not move the telescope.**

### 4. Secure the Finder Rings  
Once the finder rings are properly aligned and the object is visible through them, tape the rings in place to prevent movement.

### 5. Confirm Alignment  
When looking through the eyepiece, the target object should now match what is visible through the finder rings.

## Observing
Now go out and see the universe.  
1. The moon.
2. Jupiter and its moons.
3. Winder object, M45, The Pleiades star cluster.
4. Summer Objects, M6 and M7 open star clusters.
